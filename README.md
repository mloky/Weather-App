Testing in Progress

Update 4:
- Does not work anymore as API/Dataset source has been moved to new host.
- No intention to update code as of yet.

Update 3:
- Apparently, no API key is needed to access the API. Not sure if it is intended as of 180217.
- If they fixed it, enter your own key using the menu buttons.

Update 2:

- Datasets URL has been changed on the developer's side since 1 Oct 2016. Code now updated.
- Input your own authorization key
